## Research on Model-Based Vision for Scene Classification by Jiuqi Wang, Moyang Chen, Sym Piracha, Emma Wu

### Abstract
Abstractâ€• Recognizing scenes, where the robotic agent is in, is crucial for
autonomous robot localization, mapping, and navigation. This report presents a study on a
model-based vision system that aims to classify scenes based on input images. The 
system extracts features and properties that include dimension, lines, vanishing point, as 
well as the perceptual hash from both provided models and the input image. Then it
measures the similarity between the image and the model features according to a
self-defined cost function. The output is determined on the cost relative to the set
threshold. We find that the lazy-training algorithm can attain a satisfactory level of
accuracy only with ten model samples. The experiments show that although the attained
accuracy is only around 56% on the validation dataset, the system with the final
determined threshold achieves an accuracy as high as 87.5% on the test dataset. It is an
encouraging discovery that we deem would open more possibilities for scene recognition
of robots.
